# Ideas

## To do

- Find a good router system
- Determine how to manage user authentification (although none at first is fine)
- Find a good memoization system

## JavaScript libraries

- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for handling datetimes
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) for common operations

## React native libraries

All the following libraries should work for both iOS and Android. More are available on the [Awesome React Native page](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native).
